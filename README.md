Implementation of Li et al, "Measuring the intrinsic dimension of objective landscapes"

This is an attempt to reproduce the results from the above paper **in pytorch**. The code is adapted from the [authors' implementation](https://github.com/uber-research/intrinsic-dimension) with certain modifications.
